## About the Project
Goalify is a web app designed to help UW students manage their goals more effectively. 
The app guides students by helping them break big goals into daily actionable tasks, 
stay organized, and build consistent habits. 

### Features:

- User authentication (sign up, log in, log out)
- Goal breakdown into daily tasks by AI assistant
- Add tasks to daily to-do list
- Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
- Add new goals with a description and due date
- Goals auto-categorized by due date into: Current Goals (due today or later) and Past Goals (due before today)
- Custom react calendar component for selecting dates
- AI assistant for goal breakdown and task suggestions


## Build With
- Frontend: React with Vite
- Routing: React Router
- Database: Firebase Firestore
- Authentication: Firebase Authentication
- Styling: CSS 


## Getting Started
1. Create the Repository on GitHub (git clone https://github.com/Pimnipa226/final-project-438.git
)
2. Create the Vite + React Project
3. Get API keys from Gemini API
3. Set up Firebase project
4. Start the development process using `npm run dev` to run the app locally
5. Use `npm run build` to create a production build
6. Deploy the app using Firebase Hosting or any other hosting service


## Future Improvements
- Implement features like add daily tasks from AI API output to the task automatically
- Add reminders and progress tracking
- Improve UI design

## AI use statement
I used AI to help generate code snippets and debug issues during development.
Mainly I used ChatGPT to help with the adding task portion of my TaskGoalList.jsx React component structure, and responsive CSS styling.
- I prompted ChatGPT to help me save task data to Firebase and retrieve it for display in the user interface. 
- I also ask it to generate CSS for some of my element like the input fields to make them responsive to size of the screen and customize the React calendar to match my app color palette.


## Personal reflection
Throughout the process of building this project, I gained knowledge and hands-on experience especially in areas that were completely new to me like JavaScript and Firebase. 
When integrating AI features with user authentication and real-time database management allowed me to explore how different technologies work together to create a user experience. 
Working with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS strengthened my understanding of front-end development while using Firebase helped me learn how modern web apps handle data, security, and user information.
I also get to practice working on different APIs and cloud-based tools and put those into a single application. 
Although it was challenging at times, it pushed me to research, troubleshoot, and think more critically. Seeing the project evolve from an idea to a working application gave me a better appreciation
for the development cycle and the amount of detail required to make an app both useful and user-friendly. Overall, this project strengthened my understanding of full-stack concepts and inspired me 
to continue learning and building more intuitive applications in the future.
